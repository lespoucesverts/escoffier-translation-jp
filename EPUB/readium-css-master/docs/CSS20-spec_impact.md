# List of proposals and specs impacting Readium CSS

[Implementers’ doc]

Here is a list of all the specs and proposals which are likely to impact Readium CSS in the future. Some of them are still in their early days but you’ll probably have to review implementations once they are clearly defined and Readium CSS is updated accordingly.

The [W3C CSSWG-Drafts repo](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues) is a good way to keep up. 

Readium CSS’ fundamental approach has been reviewed and should be future proof, but you’ll have to keep the following in mind since EPUB 3.1 is now using CSS snapshots – those specs and proposals are very likely to be listed in future snapshots.
